		<p>
			I am an accomplished IT professional with over 15 years experience effectively planning, installing, configuring and optimizing computers, locally hosted servers and SaaS server applications to meet small to medium-sized business needs. My proven ability to identify and deliver solutions has served me well these last many years. While I am skilled at troubleshooting, supporting and instructing colleagues at all levels; I am also comfortable managing systems, projects and teams in a variety of small and medium business environments.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am ready to dive "deeper into the stack" and that's why I am taking the U of MN Developer Boot Camp and look forward to seeing what it feels like to build my own spaceships from my own lego bricks rather than using pre-made ones and other people's directions. When not messing around with technology I am busy training for getting back into Sprint Triathlons and trying to find time to practice my Ukulele while keeping my yard from taking over the neighborhood.
